### CREATION DATE : OCT - 2020
The project was created OC-2020 on the local machine.
This is my 1st project from the Udacity "Programming for Data Science with Python"
Nanodegree Program.

### Sakilla Movie Database
The goal was to investigate SQL Relational Database of movie rentals in two
stores and answer questions via analysis.


### Description
Used SQL queries, data analysis and visualizations and summarized all findings
and statistical data in Ð° Power Point presentation

#Question 1

    We want to understand more about the movies that families are watching.
     Based on the family friendly categories create a query that lists each
      movie, the film category it is classified in, and the number of times
      it has been rented out.

#Question 2

    Provide a table with the family-friendly film category, each of the quartiles,
    and the corresponding count of movies within each combination of film
    category for each corresponding rental duration category?

#Question 3

    We want to find out how the two stores compare in their count of rental
    orders during every month for all the years we have data for. Write a 
    query that returns the store ID for the store, the year and month and
    the number of rental orders each store has fulfilled for that month.
    Your table should include a column for each of the following: year,
    month, store ID and count of rental orders fulfilled during that month

#Question 4

    We would like to know who were our top 10 paying customers,
    how many payments they made on a monthly basis during 2007,
    and what was the amount of the monthly payments.

### Files used
We have used one ERD database with 15 tables in it.

Analyzed them with SQL and documented everything in Power Point Presentation
and PDF report.
